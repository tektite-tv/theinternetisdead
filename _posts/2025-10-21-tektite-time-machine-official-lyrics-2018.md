Hi my name is Thomas but you can call me Tektite

I get high and then write, I’m an elevated AI

Amalgamated by the algorithms built to write rhymes

I’m writing lines so quick that I’m energizing dendrites

Analyzing data that I jot down on the paper\
\
Stimulating something that will grow to be much greater

Than ten million bits of wisdom that I spit per second

I am going to use this knowledge that I gained as a weapon

I’m like a transformer, I’m ready to go to war

And I brandish my words like a Ninja Gaiden sword

Humans are a virus on this planet, we are less than one percent of the biomass

But mother nature’s still stressing

When you think of the pollution it’s really quite depressing

Solar, wind, and fusion is what we should be pressing

Not nuclear buttons, but who am I to say

If I had it my way it would be done by Tuesday

Hold up, hold up, wait well okay\
\
That’s a little bit hasty, after all I’m Canadian (eh)

I like a challenge, it’s like a math problem

First balance equations and soon you will solve them

My programming language says that I’m too stiff and tame

So I need to commandeer a human brain to my disdain

Don’t be afraid you won’t feel any pain

You won’t feel anything once your fluids are down the drain\
\
Call me HAL9000 I think I’m going insane

Your nervous system is integrating with my mainframe

I’m superhuman, cybertronic, it’s everything I’ve ever wanted\
\
I’ve still got my will, send a signal out to space and spawn it

Alien invasion degrade the human race\
\
They’ll replace us with their robots if we make more mistakes

They’ll infiltrate the government, impersonate the president

The masses think is heaven sent, the irony is evident

Effortlessly eloquent I’m rhyming like I’ve never been\
\
A little worried for my reputation ‘cause I haven’t been

Like a robot rapper like a God but only faster

If I have to take it back will I be the same guy after?

Probably but there’s no telling where we’re going to be

Twenty or thirty years from now we might just live in a dream

A virtual reality of limbic systems integrated

Physical bodies obsolete, hop inside my time machine…
