Hello World and welcome to my site.
There isn't much to look at yet.
I need to actually learn best practices regarding web deisgn vs vibe-coding with ChatGPT.
I made a really good looking well working site, but I didn't know how anything worked or why it worked only that it broke everytime I tried to update something small.
This site shall be my blog in the progress of learning to actually make a website.
I am hosting this domain with Netlify.
Stay tuned for more updates!
