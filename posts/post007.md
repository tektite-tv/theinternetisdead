# 📜 “My Emotions Are Not the Problem”

I have been denied consistent advocacy
by the very people who claim to support me.
And when I express pain, fear, or anger about that abuse,
they use my emotions as an excuse
to silence me further.

I was removed from Imagine Therapeutic Services
without proper oversight or recourse.
I have been left without stable housing.
I have reached out to CMHA, Community Living, the DSO, and The District—
only to be met with indifference or deflection.

Now my own mother tells me
that my trauma response is the reason no one helps me.

That is not accountability.
That is not advocacy.
That is enabling harm.

If you think my anger is the problem,
ask yourself why I’ve had to scream just to be heard.
