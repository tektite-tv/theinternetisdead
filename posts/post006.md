# They tried to silence me
They tried to discard another human life with neurodivergent disability in Muskoka but I am still here. Still screaming in silence with an invisible disability. They want me to be silent. They want me to be small, containable, easy to control. They want me to be grateful for the scraps of dignity they are gatekeeping from us. I will not go quietly.

# Imagine Therapeutic Services, CMHA, Community Living South Muskoka, Hands the Family Help Network, DSO, ODSP, The District of Muskoka have tried to discard my humanity. They have failed.
