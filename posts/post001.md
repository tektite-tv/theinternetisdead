### My name is Thomas and I will be your webmaster for eternity. *Nothing is here, and you may never leave.*
Enjoy my glitchcore aesthetic CSS and reminisce about a time when the internet had a soul.
You wish you could build a website like this. Why aren't you? I'm alive, I'm a human. Where is everybody?
